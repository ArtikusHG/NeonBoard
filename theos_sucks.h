// i once updated theos, and it stopped including foundation and uikit for everything. not including uikit is somewhat reasonable, but not including foundation??? that's why theos_sucks.
// thanks to pixelomer btw lol, he pointed it out to me i could just export CFLAGS = -include theos_sucks.h
#include <Foundation/Foundation.h>
#include <UIKit/UIKit.h>
